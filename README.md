# Traffic-State-Estimation-Approach

Algorithm based on the paper "Optimality condition and complexity analysis
for linearly-constrained optimization without differentiability on the boundary" by 
Haeser, Gabriel, Hongcheng Liu, and Yinyu Ye. The objective function in the implementation
is a variation of the LASSO problem, to induce sparsity in the solution vector
